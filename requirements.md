To create a commercial app like Amazon or Alibaba, you need to follow a structured approach. Here are the steps you should take next:

1. **Define Requirements and Features**:
   - List all the features you want in your app (e.g., user authentication, product listings, shopping cart, checkout, user profiles, etc.).
   - Define the user roles (e.g., customers, admins).

2. **Design the UI/UX**:
   - Create wireframes and mockups for your app screens.
   - Ensure a user-friendly and intuitive design.

3. **Set Up the Backend**:
   - Choose a backend technology (e.g., Node.js, Django, etc.).
   - Set up a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
   - Create APIs for user authentication, product management, order processing, etc.

4. **Implement Frontend Features**:
   - Start by setting up navigation and basic screens.
   - Implement user authentication (login, registration).
   - Create product listing and detail screens.
   - Implement shopping cart and checkout functionality.
   - Add user profile and settings screens.

5. **Integrate Backend with Frontend**:
   - Connect your frontend app with the backend APIs.
   - Ensure data is fetched and displayed correctly.

6. **Testing**:
   - Perform unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.
   - Fix any bugs or issues.

7. **Deployment**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
   - Deploy your app to app stores (Google Play, Apple App Store) and web hosting services.

8. **Maintenance and Updates**:
   - Regularly update your app with new features and improvements.
   - Monitor performance and user feedback.

Let's start with the first step: **Defining Requirements and Features**.
